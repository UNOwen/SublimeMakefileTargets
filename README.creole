== What MBT is ==
MakefileBuildTargets is an alternative Sublime Text 2 build system for Make, which adds basic support for Makefile build targets. The differences from the bundled version are as follows:
* MBT will search for the nearest Makefile, relative to the edited file. Bundled version will always search for project-level Makefile.
* MBT will provide the list of available build targets, if there are multiple choices. Bundled version will execute the first one anyway.

== What is obviously wrong about MBT ==
* There is no sticking to project-defined include paths, the Makefile will be searched until file-system root is reached. As a consequence, MBT will not default to project-level Makefile, if there is one near the edited file.
* MBT will always ask which target to run, if there is more than one option (no quick-run).

Therefore, MBT **is not a replacement** for bundled Sublime Text build system for Make, it was designed for "special needs" of it's author.
